# Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a popular programming approach that helps organize and structure code using real-world concepts like **objects** and **classes**. It makes programs easier to build, understand, and maintain—especially as they grow larger and more complex.

> This guide focuses on the **fundamentals of OOP**.

## What is OOP?

OOP stands for **Object-Oriented Programming**. It's a way of programming where we model things as **objects** — each with their own **data (attributes)** and **actions (methods)**.

Imagine a program as a group of things (like cars, people, or animals), each doing something. OOP helps you build and manage those "things" in your code.

## Core Concepts of OOP

### 1. **Class**
A class is like a **blueprint**. It defines what an object should know and what it should be able to do.

```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, brand, model):
        self.brand = brand
        self.model = model

    def drive(self):
        print(f"{self.brand} {self.model} is driving.")
```
### 2. **Object**
An object is a real-world instance of a class. You can create many objects from a single class.
```python
my_car = Car("Toyota", "Corolla")
my_car.drive()  # Output: Toyota Corolla is driving.
```
### 3. Constructor (__init__)
The constructor is a special method that gets called when you create a new object. It sets up the object's data.

### 4. Attributes and Methods
Attributes are like variables inside an object (e.g., brand, model).

Methods are like functions inside an object (e.g., drive()).

### 5. The self Keyword
In Python, self is used to refer to the current object instance. It lets the object access its own attributes and methods.

### 6. Instance vs Class Variables

Instance Variables: Unique to each object (e.g., a car’s color).

Class Variables: Shared across all instances of a class (e.g., number of wheels).

```python
class Car:
    wheels = 4  # Class variable

    def __init__(self, color):
        self.color = color  # Instance variable
```
## Real-Life Use Cases of OOP

OOP is used in almost every field of software development:

1. Game Development: Players, enemies, and items are objects.

2. Web Development: Websites use classes to represent users, products, etc.

3. Software Tools: File managers, calculators, or GUI apps use objects for each window or tool.

4. Enterprise Applications: Banking, inventory, and employee systems rely on OOP.

## Why Use OOP

| Benefit                | Description                                          |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
|  Reusability         | Use classes across multiple projects.                |
|  Maintainability     | Easily fix or update code in small parts.            |
|  Scalability         | Add new features without rewriting everything.       |
|  Real-world modeling | Code looks and behaves like real-world entities.     |
|  Modularity          | Break large problems into smaller, manageable parts. |

## OOP vs Procedural Programming

| Feature    | OOP                          | Procedural Programming       |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Structure  | Based on objects and classes | Based on functions and steps |
| Data       | Tied to objects              | Shared across functions      |
| Best for   | Complex, large applications  | Simple, small programs       |
| Code Reuse | Via classes and inheritance  | Via functions only           |

## When to Use OOP?
### Use OOP when:
- You have repeating patterns or behaviors.

- Your system has real-world entities (e.g., users, products).

- The project is large, complex, or growing.

- You need collaboration among multiple developers.

- You plan to maintain the project long-term.

### Avoid OOP when:
- Writing small scripts or quick utilities.

- You don’t need object modeling or long-term maintainability.

## Summary

- OOP helps you write clean, reusable, and organized code using classes and objects.

- It’s widely used in many types of applications — from games to enterprise software.

- Start with understanding how classes, objects, attributes, and methods work.
