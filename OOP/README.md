# Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a popular programming approach that helps organize and structure code using real-world concepts like **objects** and **classes**. It makes programs easier to build, understand, and maintain—especially as they grow larger and more complex.

> This guide focuses on the **fundamentals of OOP**. 

---

## What is OOP?

OOP stands for **Object-Oriented Programming**. It's a way of programming where we model things as **objects** — each with their own **data (attributes)** and **actions (methods)**.

Imagine a program as a group of things (like cars, people, or animals), each doing something. OOP helps you build and manage those "things" in your code.

## Core Concepts of OOP
> Using the cake recipe method for better understanding. 
### 1. **Class**
A class is like a **blueprint**. It defines what an object should know and what it should be able to do.

- A class is like a cake recipe you find in a cookbook.

- It tells you what ingredients you need (flour, sugar, eggs).

- It explains how to bake the cake (steps, oven temperature, baking time).

- But the recipe itself is not the cake — it’s just the instructions.

```python
class Car:
class Cake:
    pass  # A blueprint for cakes, empty for now

```
### 2. **Object**
An object is a real-world instance of a class. You can create many objects from a single class.

- An object is the real cake you make by following the recipe.

- You can bake many cakes from the same recipe.

- Each cake can be a little different — one might be chocolate, another vanilla.

```python
cake1 = Cake()  # cake1 is an object (instance) of the Cake class
print(type(cake1))  # <class '__main__.Cake'>
```

### 3. Constructor (__init__)
The constructor is a special method that gets called when you create a new object. It sets up the object's data.

- The constructor is like the process of baking the cake.

- When you decide to bake, you start following the recipe step-by-step.

```python
class Cake:
    def __init__(self, flavor, frosting):
        # These are instance variables initialized when object is created
        self.flavor = flavor
        self.frosting = frosting
    def describe(self):
        print(f"This cake is {self.flavor} flavored with {self.frosting} frosting.")
# Creating an object of the Cake class
my_cake = Cake("vanilla", "chocolate")
# Calling a method on the object
my_cake.describe()
```

This process creates the actual cake (object) with its specific flavor and size.
### 4. Attributes and Methods
Attributes are like variables inside an object (e.g., brand, model).

Methods are like functions inside an object (e.g., drive()).

- Attributes are the ingredients and properties of the cake.

- Ingredients like sugar, flour, and eggs.

- Features like cake size, flavor, and frosting color.

- Each cake (object) can have different attribute values — maybe you use more sugar, or choose a different frosting color.

- Methods are the actions or things you can do with the cake.

- Slice the cake.

- Eat the cake.

- Decorate the cake.

- These are like the "verbs" or functions that define what you can do with the cake.

**Attribite**

```python
class Cake:
    def __init__(self):
        self.flavor = "vanilla"  # flavor is an attribute

cake1 = Cake()
print(cake1.flavor)  # Output: vanilla
```

**Method**

```python
class Cake:
    def describe(self):
        print("This is a delicious cake!")

cake1 = Cake()
cake1.describe()  # Output: This is a delicious cake!
```

### 5. The self Keyword
In Python, self is used to refer to the current object instance. It lets the object access its own attributes and methods.

- When you’re working on this particular cake, you need a way to say “Hey, this is my frosting” or “My flavor is vanilla.”

- In programming, self means “this exact object” you’re working with.

- It’s like pointing at your cake and saying, “This frosting belongs to me!”
```python
class Cake:
    def __init__(self, flavor):
        self.flavor = flavor  # self refers to this specific object

    def describe(self):
        print(f"This cake is {self.flavor} flavored.")

cake1 = Cake("chocolate")
cake1.describe()  # Output: This cake is chocolate flavored.
```

### 6. Static , Instance and Class Variables

Static variable: A static variable is a variable that belongs to the class itself, not to any individual object (instance) created from the class. This means all objects share the same static variable.Changing the static variable in one place affects it for all objects. Static variables are often used to store information that is common to all objects or to keep track of something about the class as a whole (like counting how many objects have been created).

Instance Variables : An instance variable is a variable that belongs to a specific object (instance) created from a class. Each object has its own copy of these variables. Changing an instance variable affects only that particular object. Instance variables store data unique to each object.

Class Variables : A class variable is a variable that belongs to the class itself, not to any individual object. All objects created from the class share the same class variable. Changing the class variable affects it for all objects. Class variables are used to store data or settings that should be consistent across all objects.

- You bake many cakes (objects) using that recipe.

- Now, say you want to keep track of how many cakes have been baked so far.

- This number is shared across all cakes, not just one specific cake.

- This shared number is like a static variable: it belongs to the recipe, not to any single cake.

- Instance variables are the actual ingredients amounts and choices for your particular cake.

- Your cake might have 2 cups of sugar, while another cake has 1 cup.

- Your cake’s frosting might be chocolate, another’s vanilla.

- Class variables are ingredients or settings shared by all cakes made from the recipe.

- For example, maybe all cakes use the same brand of flour or the oven temperature is fixed for every cake.

- If the recipe says “Bake at 350°F,” that’s a class variable — same for every cake.

**Static variable**

```python
class Cake:
    cake_count = 0  # static/class variable

    def __init__(self):
        Cake.cake_count += 1

cake1 = Cake()
cake2 = Cake()
print(Cake.cake_count)  # 2
```
**Instance Variable**

```python
class Cake:
    def __init__(self, flavor):
        self.flavor = flavor  # instance variable

cake1 = Cake("strawberry")
cake2 = Cake("vanilla")

print(cake1.flavor)  # strawberry
print(cake2.flavor)  # vanilla
```
***Class variable**

```python
class Cake:
    oven_temperature = 350  # class variable shared by all instances

cake1 = Cake()
cake2 = Cake()

print(cake1.oven_temperature)  # 350
print(cake2.oven_temperature)  # 350

# Changing via class
Cake.oven_temperature = 375
print(cake1.oven_temperature)  # 375
print(cake2.oven_temperature)  # 375
```
## Real-Life Use Cases of OOP

OOP is used in almost every field of software development:

1. Game Development: Players, enemies, and items are objects.

2. Web Development: Websites use classes to represent users, products, etc.

3. Software Tools: File managers, calculators, or GUI apps use objects for each window or tool.

4. Enterprise Applications: Banking, inventory, and employee systems rely on OOP.

## Why Use OOP

| Benefit                | Description                                          |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
|  Reusability         | Use classes across multiple projects.                |
|  Maintainability     | Easily fix or update code in small parts.            |
|  Scalability         | Add new features without rewriting everything.       |
|  Real-world modeling | Code looks and behaves like real-world entities.     |
|  Modularity          | Break large problems into smaller, manageable parts. |

## OOP vs Procedural Programming

| Feature    | OOP                          | Procedural Programming       |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Structure  | Based on objects and classes | Based on functions and steps |
| Data       | Tied to objects              | Shared across functions      |
| Best for   | Complex, large applications  | Simple, small programs       |
| Code Reuse | Via classes and inheritance  | Via functions only           |

## When to Use OOP?
### Use OOP when:
- You have repeating patterns or behaviors.

- Your system has real-world entities (e.g., users, products).

- The project is large, complex, or growing.

- You need collaboration among multiple developers.

- You plan to maintain the project long-term.

### Avoid OOP when:
- Writing small scripts or quick utilities.

- You don’t need object modeling or long-term maintainability.

## Summary

- OOP helps you write clean, reusable, and organized code using classes and objects.

- It’s widely used in many types of applications — from games to enterprise software.

- Start with understanding how classes, objects, attributes, and methods work.
